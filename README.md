<h2>Motivation</h2>

Everyone needs to eat, and most people need to cook at least some of the time.
I wanted to make an app so that people could have, in one place, all the 
information they need to determine what to cook and how to cook it.

<h2>Summary</h2>

This app allows users to search for any type of food they would like to make, and 
returns nutrition information for that food, along with the most popular text recipes 
and recipe videos for that food. Users can click on the links for the text recipes to 
be taken to the URL for that recipe, and they can click on the links for the recipe 
videos to be taken to YouTube to view the video.
